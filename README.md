# Creating an Interactive Resume Using HTML & CSS

In today's digital age, standing out among job applicants requires creativity and technical expertise. By combining HTML and CSS, you can build an impressive, modern, and accessible resume that sets you apart from others. Let's walk through the process of creating an eye-catching HTML/CSS resume, highlighting best practices along the way.

## Choosing the right tools
Before diving into the nitty-gritty details, select the appropriate text editor and browser for testing purposes. Popular choices for text editors include Visual Studio Code, Atom, and Sublime Text. For browsers, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge are excellent options due to their robust developer tools and wide usage.

## Setting up basic structure
Start by creating a solid HTML base for your resume. Organize content into logical sections, such as header, experience, education, and skills. Utilizing semantic elements—such as `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>`—will improve code readability and search engine optimization. Don't forget to add necessary metadata, including the title, character encoding, and viewport meta tags inside the `<head>` section.

Example:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <!-- Metadata here -->
</head>
<body>
    <header></header>
    <main>
        <section id="experience"></section>
        <section id="education"></section>
        <section id="skills"></section>
    </main>
</body>
</html>
